This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Migrations / Seeds in Prisma ORM
All these commands automatically generate typescript interfaces for the database schema
in [prisma/interfaces.ts](prisma/interfaces.ts)

Prisma schema is in [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma)

Main file of seeds is [prisma/seed.ts](prisma/seed.ts)

```bash
# create a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# reset migrations also execute the seeds
prisma migrate reset

# reset migrations without executing the seeds
prisma migrate reset --skip-seed

# execute only seeds
prisma db seed
```
